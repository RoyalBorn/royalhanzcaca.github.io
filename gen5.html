                            <p>
                                Yukihina Lamy is a snow elf virtual youtuber who is a part of Hololive 5th gen. Her YouTube account was created on April 12th and debuted on August 8th. She is most known for her soft-spoken voice and gentle nature on streams. Lamy enjoys playing various video games such as Minecraft and ARK but is averse to playing horror games which she has played on occasion with fellow gen mate Shishiro Botan, who enjoyed ceaselessly teasing her and found amusement in her petrified reactions. Talking and drinking streams are another favorite of Lamy's and her drinking habits have earned her the reputation of being the drunkard of gen 5.<br>

                        <p>
                            Meet the ‚ÄúLove Warrior‚Äù Nenechi, a girl who possesses a quiet fire in her heart! She hails from Planet Tao Tao, and has come to earth to pursue her idol dream! Let‚Äôs support her immensely!
                            Her character backstory shares a lot of similarities with the character Kagura from Gintama, including the ‚Äúaru‚Äù verbal tic. Her design borrows heavily from chinese-style dresses, and her character emote ü•ü: dumpling: is taken from her favorite food, gyoza.
                            Some months after her debut, she stopped adding ‚Äúaru‚Äù at the end of her sentences. When fans asked why she doesn‚Äôt use ‚Äúaru‚Äù anymore, she mentions that she‚Äôs been pronouncing them so fast it‚Äôs become inaudible to her viewer's ears.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 5: Shishiro Botan</h5>
                        <p>
                            Debuting on August 14th, 2020, Shishiro Botan is a white lion Vtuber from the 5th generation of Hololive known as holofive. She hails from gangtown and had a rough time growing up. She is 22 years old... or 23. Or 25, or 26. Or even 27 or 28 years old.
                            Botan is known for her gaming prowess in FPS and various online multiplayer games. She also grinded her way to Master rank in Apex legends just to make it look good on her portfolio before applying for Hololive. Her early COD streams quickly caught the eyes of Activision JP and was gifted a pair of Modern warfare NVG. She was also invited as a guest alongside Kotetsun4 for the "COD Challengers Japan National Team Finals" festival held on October 3rd, 2020.
                            She is tech savvy, owning 2 PCs, a main and sub with 4 monitors. She also likes to build PC computers as a hobby. Her new PC setup was sponsored by ASUS ROG and Crucial. Due to her tech prowess, other members of 5th gen like to ask her assistance whenever they have any technical difficulties.
                            One of the skills that we as viewers should watch out for are her video editing skills, which she is still improving upon. She edited her own debut intro video and 5th gen's ochame kinou cover. She likes to upload her gameplay montage videos from time to time. She also has interests in ancient China which got her into learning Chinese, and she can speak it at a basic level.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 5: Omaru Polka</h5>
                        <p>
                            Omaru Polka (Â∞æ‰∏∏„Éù„É´„Ç´) is a member of the 5th generation of Hololive talents, and debuted on August 16, 2020. She is a quarter-part fennec circus-less ring mistress who decided to turn Hololive into her circus.
                            She streams talk streams, singing/karaoke streams and sometimes game streams, even if by her own admission she is not very good at them. She tried keeping a stream schedule at first, but eventually gave up: dubbing herself a "guerrilla queen", she now schedules her own streams from anywhere between 15 minutes to 2 hours in advance with next to no prior warning, and at unpredictable times ranging from early in the morning to very late at night.
                            Because of her circus theming, Polka's representative mark is a circus tent (üé™). A bell (üîî) is also associated with Polka by her fans because of her prolific use of it in streams.<br>
