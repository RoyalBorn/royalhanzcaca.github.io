                        <h5>Generation 3: Usada Pekora</h5>
                            <p>
                                A young and hip rabbit from Pekoland that appends "peko" at the end of her sentences. Part of the 3rd generation, Hololive Fantasy, she is eternally 111 years old (increments by 0.0000….1 every year). The conversion from Pekoland years to human years frequently changes depending on her mood. In the beginning, Pekora mentioned that when converted, it roughly equals late teens and early twenties; however, during her loli stream, she established that she was 3 years old (1 + 1 + 1 = 3 years old), and has continued to use that conversion method since. Known for her chaotic personality and motormouth pace, she's quickly become one of the most well-known members of Hololive.
                                The carrots she has in her hair are raised in her family's farm. She wears them both as a fashion and snack. Although it is difficult to see, under the white dress is a bunny girl outfit. Not only is showing full body rare, she rarely shows full upper body, so seeing anything else is rare during the stream. Her scarf is a living being called Don-chan, which is always with her.
                                When she's upset, her right ear folds. When she plays horror games, it's permanently folded. Her ears are not detachable. According to Pekora, the reason why she has 4 ears (2 human, 2 rabbit) is because "humans like something resembling them, so to help me blend in, mom gave them to me." However, she gave one pair of her rabbit ears to Kiryu Coco on her birthday, claiming it'll grow back quickly. Additionally, her tail is hidden in the idol costume because she put it inside her spats.
                                Her representative emote is a pair of dancers in bunny suits (female). <br>

                        <h5>Generation 3: Shiranui Flare</h5>
                        <p>
                            Shiranui Flare (不知火フレア) is the half-elf of Hololive's 3rd generation. She debuted on August 7th, 2019, and later debuted on bilibili on October 25th, 2019. Flare is considered as a big sister figure within her generation, and is also well-liked with other Hololive members due to her calm, yet kind demeanor. She received her first alternate outfit during the 2019 New Year's relay, which she used for all of her streams. This outfit also received a L2D update on July 15th, 2020. Her fourth outfit, a casual sailor-style dress, was unveiled on November 14th, 2020.
                            Flare's 3D debut which was originally announced for a reveal on March 29th, 2020 was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic (due to the government's discouragement of public gathering). A "re-announcement" was made on June 10th, 2020 to reveal her 3D and finally, Flare's 3D model debuted on the date June 13, 2020. This model had significant updates compared to the model that was used during Nonstop Story.
                            Flare refers to her friends as Elfriend (エルフレンド), a portmanteau of the word "Elf" and "Friend".<br>

                        <h5>Generation 3: Shirogane Noel</h5>
                        <p>
                            Shirogane Noel (白銀ノエル), born November 24th, is the knight captain that belongs to Hololive 3rd Generation. One of the three human members of Hololive Fantasy, this gyūdon (牛丼) loving knight debuted on August 8th, 2019 in Youtube and on her BiliBili roughly a month after on September 29th, 2019. Her 3D debut was on November 17th, 2019 with the creator of the 3D being ぽんぷ長(@paint002). And her second costume, the New Year's costume was released on January 2nd, 2020. Her fans are referred to collectively as Order of Shirogane (白銀聖騎士団), and she prefers to be called Danchou (団長) which roughly translates to captain or leader, with her being the Guild leader of the Order of Shirogane.
                            Noel is strongly associated with both gyūdon, which she loves so much (along with meat in general), and muscles which is a representation of her strength as a knight, and also accurately represents her strength which is above average among the other members of Hololive.
                            Noel was one of the primary ASMR-focused members of Hololive, offering a wide array of calming and relaxing ASMR as her main form of content. However, this changed after YouTube began to harshly take down many ASMR streams over a short period of time. Nowadays, Noel's content is very varied and spread out, including but not limited to video game streams (with which she usually tackles the game she plays one-at-a-time on her own pace), comfortable chat streams (including yakiniku-eating streams, as well as drinking chat streams, which happen quite frequently due to Noel's general resistance to alcohol) and karaoke streams. Her content is much more evenly distributed among the aforementioned types compared to the past.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 3: Houshou Marine</h5>
                        <p>
                            Houshou Marine (宝鐘マリン) born July 30th, is a pirate cosplayer and a Vtuber for the Hololive 3rd Generation. Marine is a beautiful and elegant young lady who is definitely 17 years old despite her knowledge of early 2000 anime and internet memes. She is often referred to as "Senchou" (船長 - Ship Captain) by her viewers and peers. She loves jewels, treasure, and money. Her dream is to become a pirate and go treasure hunting. In order to get a pirate ship, she is now stacking up money as a VTuber on the great lands, just like how the other land-lovers do. She acts like a big sister (despite definitely only being 17) and sometimes often seduces other VTubers who she then draws in questionable situations.
                            Marine is a competent artist who can easily produce artwork at the quality of a mangaka. She has mentioned previously that she would like to have pursued being a mangaka but does not believe she would be comfortable with keeping up with the tight deadlines and stress of it.
                            Often joked she is not an actual pirate or captain as she lacks a ship and crew, and is instead cosplaying as a Pirate Captain.
                            Her representative emote is a flag & skull (known as Jolly Roger) because of her pirate theming.<br>
