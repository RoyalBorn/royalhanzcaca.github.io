                        <h5>Generation 4: Amane Kanata</h5>
                            <p>
                                Amane Kanata is an angel Vtuber and member of Hololive 4th Generation. Kanata debuted on December 27, 2019[11] after the creation of her Youtube Channel on December 4, 2019. In a tweet, she states herself as a Student Council Secretary. She is friendly and kind towards others. She describes herself as shy and conceals this fact by maintaining a cool facade. After using Microsoft PowerPoint in her debut stream, she was nicknamed PPT (PowerPoint Tenshi). However, fans often joke that PPT can stand for a number of things, most notably Perfect Pitch Tenshi for Kanata's extraordinary vocal range.
                                Kanata lacks a sense of fashion and has been called out by fellow 4th generation member Kiryu Coco, who claims to only have ever seen Kanata wear two different outfits. She also lacks a sense for naming things, as revealed by a Twitter poll for the name of her YouTube membership, the three options being "Kanatas", "THE Kanata", and "Kanata Fan Club".
                                Her representative emote is "dizzy", because it resembles an angel halo.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 4: Tsunomaki Watame</h5>
                        <p>
                            Tsunomaki Watame (角巻わため), born on June 6th, is the 4 years old (in sheep years) resident sheep of Hololive 4th Generation. The fluffiest addition to Hololive yet, Watame is one of the kindest and most emotional members among the 4th Generation, if not among all of Hololive. Watame debuted on December 29, 2019. She is the third to debut for the 4th Generation of Hololive. Watame loves puns and wordplay, thus the puns for the names of her fans and members.
                            Watame's uploads are heavily music oriented. She has two main programs, "Watame no Uta", and "Watame Night Fever." In addition to her music-based content, Watame is also a gamer. While she is not as hardcore as other members of Hololive like Minato Aqua, she enjoys a playing a wide variety of video games in different genres. This includes but is not limited to ARK, Apex, Minecraft, Splatoon, and Mario Kart. Watame is flexible in terms of the types of games she plays, which allows her to participate in many multiplayer game collabs with her fellow Hololive members.
                            Watame is well known for the catchphrase "Watame wa warukunai yo ne (わためは悪くないよね)" which roughly translates to "Watame did nothing wrong." The phrase started in an "apology" video (due to her previous stream having connection issues)] and has stuck around ever since.
                            Her representative emote is a ram, which should not be confused with the sheep emote. It was chosen due to the ram emote having horns compared to the sheep emote which has none.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 4: Tokoyami Towa</h5>
                        <p>
                            Tokoyami Towa (常闇トワ) is a member of Hololive 4th Generation and a "small devil" (小悪魔) from the devil world.
                            She often talks like a gyaru and addresses herself as Towa-sama (トワ様). The hat she has on is actually her pet Bibi (ビビ), a guardian and protector given to her by her mother in order to look after her during her studies. When asked if there would be Bibi hat merchandise, she answered that there is only one Bibi and that he is not for sale.
                            She is an avid FPS player, with the current FPS games that she usually plays on-stream being Valorant and APEX.
                            Despite being a devil, she is often referred to as an angel due to her behavior, much to her dismay.
                            Some instances of her angel-like behavior include:
                            •	Having a healthy sleep schedule and the tendency to do early morning streams. Kiryu Coco has also questioned if Towa is actually an angel because of this on an Asacoco episode.
                            •	Being known to cook healthy meals.
                            •	Surprising her fellow 4th Generation Hololive members with cakes during the Hololive 4th Generation takoyaki party hosted at her place. She also washed the dishes afterwards on her own.
                            Her representative emote is a Space Invader.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 4: Himemori Luna</h5>
                        <p>
                            Himemori Luna (姫森ルーナ), born October 10th, is a member of Hololive 4th Generation. Described as a 0-year-old princess of sweets, Luna acts in a childlike manner and is dressed appropriately cutely in all pink. Debuting on January 4th, 2020, Luna is the final member of Hololive 4th Generation. Her twitter was created 3 days earlier at January 1st, 2020.
                            Luna's fan group is referred to as "Luknights" (ルーナイト), a portmanteau of Luna and Knights, giving the fans an image of a group of knights that answers to the Princess of sweets herself.
                            As a "0-year-old princess", her speech is relatively childish, often employing simple words and sentences (fully intentionally). She usually adds the words "nanora" (なのら) to the end of her sentences, including on tweets, as a verbal tic. Luna also has a sort of catchphrase that is used to start streams and sometimes just randomly on other occasions, namely "Nnaaaaaa"(んなあああああ), with the length of "a" always changing. This "catchphrase" is so characteristic of Luna that it is the go-to for any member that tries to imitate her, as imitating her voice is apparently difficult (being the voice of a 0-year-old princess).<br>
