                        <h5>Generation 1: Yozora Mel</h5>
                            <p>
                                Yozora Mel is a vampire who is a member of Hololive 1st Generation. Her debut was on May 13th, 2018.
                                Despite being a vampire, she does not like blood and will instead drink Acerola juice.
                                Her representative emote is a star due to her last name "Yozora", which translates to "night sky".
                                Yozora Mel is an individual with a calming, caring and sweet personality. Her calm voice and demeanor make her quite relaxing to watch and she rarely tends to shout or scream excessively even in the face of unexpected events. She does however have the tendency to act lewd, especially in collaboration streams with close friend Yuzuki Choco, which belies her innocent and sweet demeanor.  Her ASMR streams were a fan favorite and of course added to her provocative perception. However, she privated all her earlier ASMR content much like many of the other hololive members after her channel was demonetized, although the cause was due to a song, she had posted prior to doing so being copyright flagged by YouTube.
                                Mel enjoys holding talking streams which allows her to interact more with her fans and is fond of her Kapu-min for the support and encouragement they had shown her during her hiatus. After the harassment she had faced, Mel came out with a public statement on May16th in the hopes that no other hololive member would have to go through what she experienced thus further highlighting her caring nature.

                        <h5>Generation 1: Shirakami Fubuki</h5>
                        <p>
                            Shirakami Fubuki (白上フブキ) born October 5 is a fox girl in Hololive 1st Generation and is the leader of hololive GAMERS.
                            She is most known for her short-skit videos posted on Twitter and Youtube. Having an exposure to western and eastern culture memes, she demonstrates it to her audience in some shape or form. She is dubbed as the "Queen of Memes", among other related titles that the fans have given her.
                            She plays a variety of games, and often loves to try out any kind of games in any genres. Despite saying that she doesn't like horror games, she seems to enjoy streaming and playing them. When she was asked about her skills, she admitted that she had terrible aim in FPS games. She is also known to be a poor driver, having a tendency to mess around with her colleagues to get a laugh out of them as well.
                            She is known to be a whale (high spender) in gacha games and any other games with similar aspects, and has shown streaming her rolls in mobile games like FGO and Twisted Wonderland.
                            In Japanese, the onomatopoeia for a fox’s bark is “kon-kon.” which sounds like "corn". As a result, corn has become Fubuki’s representative emoji.

                        <h5>Generation 1: Natsuiro Matsuri</h5>
                        <p>
                            Natsuiro Matsuri (夏色まつり) born July 22 is a VTuber under Hololive 1st Generation. She is a freshman and a member of the cheerleading club. She likes fun things such as festivals and events. Her name, "Matsuri," translates to "Festival," which suits the lively and cheerful theme around her. Because of this, her representative emote is a lantern often used at Japanese festivals.
                            Matsuri enjoys many types of games, such as simulation games, mobile games, and shooting games, though she has a terrible time with horror games. She has become very skilled at FPS games like APEX Legends and Valorant. She is also a good teacher, having been previously approached by some of her juniors to teach and help them in APEX. This includes Uruha Rushia and Kiryu Coco who are complete beginners to the game.
                            Matsuri enjoys singing and occasionally does karaoke streams. She is part of a singing pair MatsuRikka with Rikkaroid from Holostars. She gets along really well and does a lot of collaborations with Shirakami Fubuki, and the pair is usually called NatsuFubu. Another member that Matsuri gets along really well is Himemori Luna. They named their pair as FestivalLuna (フェステイバルーナ).
                            One of Matsuri's dreams is for her to become a voice actress, one that she has taken a number of steps towards fulfilling with a number of minor roles, including voicing a minor character in the mobile game "Brown Dust" (known as "Brave Nine" outside Japan).

                        <h5>Generation 1: Aki Rosenthal</h5>
                        <p>
                            Aki Rosenthal (nicknamed Akirose) belongs to the Hololive 1st Generation. She debuted alongside Natsuiro Matsuri and Shirakami Fubuki. Because she didn't have pc nor laptop at beginning, and only had a phone provided by Cover, Aki used Mirrativ for her debut stream.
                            Aki is half-elf half-siren from another dimension, with her mother being a siren and her father an elf. Aki Rosenthal is not actually her real name, but a name given to her by Yagoo so she would have an understandable and easily pronounceable name here on Earth.
                            Aki's most distinctive trait are her floating twintails, which are connected to another dimension via mysterious power. She is also able to produce a wild variety of objects and materials from between her thighs, the nature of this 'portal' is just as mysterious as her twintails.
                            Aki's content used to be mostly focused on ASMR alongside some online games and live-cooking, but with her demonetization in December and later remonetization, she has been doing ASMR less often. She still does ASMR sometimes and she often has unique ideas, such as dish washing ASMR and gaming chair building ASMR. Aki also does binaural ASMR music.
                            Her representative emote is an apple.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 1: Akai Haato</h5>
                        <p>
                            Akai Haato is a member of Hololive 1st Generation.
                            Her name "Akai" translates to "red" and "Haato" is how Japanese pronounces the word "heart", so she is strongly associated with the color red and hearts.
                            Haato is a Japanese exchange student who studied in Australia. She returned to Japan in late 2020.
                            Haato is weak to horror and jumpscares and will cry easily if she makes a mistake. She started out as a Tsundere but has since become more sociable. Despite the air of superiority, she displays (sometimes even teasing/light bullying her fans), she will not hesitate to play the fool to entertain the audience. When she gets all emotional and serious, she really, really opens up to her audience about her feelings and problems.
                            Haato often does things on a whim and is self-centered. She’s a contrarian that tends to find things bothersome in addition to being very hasty and easily bored. She plays around with this personality with her viewers, but her true nature is that she is very loving with her viewers.
                            Her actions and choice of words stand out for being childish, but what also stands out is how she sometimes really behaves like a grownup and shows her philosophical thinking.<br>
