                        <h5>Generation 2: Minato Aqua</h5>
                            <p>
                                Minato Aqua (湊あくあ) is a marine maid Virtual YouTuber for Hololive 2nd Generation unit. Her YouTube channel was created on July 31st and her twitter account was created few days later. On August 08th 2018 she posted her video debut to YouTube. On April 8th 2019 she debuted her first 3D model and debuted her 3D swimsuit model a few months later in August 17th 2019. She also got a New Year Live2D costume in January 2nd 2020.
                                Aqua is most known to be a cute airhead maid who likes to prank her friends, but somehow it almost always backfires due to the combinations of her less than desirable luck and lack of preparations. Because of that, she tends to be the target of jokes and pranks from other members.
                                She loves to play competitive PVP games like Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, League of Legends, and Apex Legends (where she managed to finish Season 4 at Diamond 4). She also likes to complete challenge runs of games, some examples being beating Dark Souls in under 3 hours, a Sekiro speedrun in under 2 hours, or endurance Apex Legend stream until Diamond.
                                According to Aqua she joined Hololive as she was very introverted and wanted to be more social with other people. She auditioned for Hololive without knowing really what it was, only realizing at the audition that it is the agency with Tokino Sora and Shirakami Fubuki in it, that she knew of already.
                                She admits she is a hikkikomori, but doesn't mind it and only wishes she could be better at socializing.
                                Her representative emote is an anchor due to her marine theme and anchors on her dress.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 2: Murasaki Shion</h5>
                        <p>
                            Murasaki Shion born December 8, is a female black magician belonging to Hololive 2nd Generation. She debuted in August 17., debuted her 3D model in May 12, and in August 01st got her 2nd costume. She received her swimsuit in August 26 and finally got her New Years costume in January 02nd
                            Shion is well-known for her smug attitude and love for puns. She is commonly seen as an annoying little brat ("kusogaki") because of her behavior and attitude especially towards fellow gen mate Minato Aqua who she also has a friendly rivalry with. The two occasionally hold collaborate streams, most commonly in the game Minecraft, which often end up in pranks and light-hearted sabotage. The two of them along with Nakiri Ayame form the "Manji-Gumi Group".
                            Shion has a preference for Nintendo Games and is seen to play them quite often. She unquestionably can't handle horror but enjoys playing other games casually. She can't take being mocked but she also loves doing so to anyone she feels like and will try her best to squeeze in any jokes or puns that usually fall flat.
                            Her representative emote is a crescent moon.<br>

                        <p>
                            Nakiri Ayame (Japanese: 百鬼あやめ) born December 13, is an oni and a member of Hololive 2nd Generation. Although her Twitter account and her Youtube Channel were both created on August 1, 2018, and August 11, 2018, respectively, she debuted on September 3, 2018. Her 3D model debut was on May 17, 2019 and soon after, on August 9, 2019, she debuted her 3D Swimsuit model.  Her second outfit was announced on Twitter and was revealed on Youtube in a livestream on November 23, 2019. 
                            She streams a variety of games on her channel, like Minecraft — where she is possibly the best builder in Hololive — or FPS games such as PUBG or Apex Legends. (Where she ended Season 4 at Diamond 4) Other games include Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Monster Hunter World (and its expansion, Iceborne), Mario Kart, ARK (though only for a few streams), Rhythm Heaven, Splatoon and League of Legends.
                            She's known for her soothing voice and infectious giggles and laughs during her stream. She's also notoriously bad at waking up, as she's always the last to wake up in multiple morning wake-up streams. She also sings a lot on her streams. 
                            Her great luck is unmatched in all of Hololive when it comes to videogames and odds. Her representative emote is a smiling "Oni" face, since she is an oni.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 2: Yuzuki Choco</h5>
                        <p>
                            Yuzuki Choco (癒月ちょこ) is the local school nurse demon of Hololive 2nd Generation hailing from the Demonic-Realm Academy. Despite people often mistaking her as a succubus (perhaps to her overwhelming charm and expert-level skill of teasing), she has clearly stated that she is not one.

Choco-sensei debuted on YouTube at September 4, 2018 with her Twitter account being created much earlier at August 2, 2018. Among fellow members of 2nd Gen, it is fair to say that Choco-sensei has the definite adult-charm to her, not only in her design, but also in her demeanor. She had her 3D Debut on the date May 25, 2019 and her 2nd L2D outfit at July 25, 2019. Along with everyone else, Choco-sensei also got a New Years outfit at December 31, 2019. Her third outfit (which have a maid motif) was revealed on October 25, 2020. The new outfit also comes with update 2.1 for her L2D (which was already updated to 2.0 before at July 29, 2020)
                            Choco-sensei's fanbase is called Choco Mate (ちょこめいと). Also, Choco usually refers to other streamers with the honorifics -sama(様).<br>

                        <h5>Generation 2: Oozora Subaru</h5>
                        <p>
                            Oozora Subaru is an MMA and e-sports club manager who debuted as part of Hololive 2nd Generation.
                            Although tomboyish in nature, her feminine side often shows itself during interactions with her friends.
                            She is often teased as a comedian because of how naturally takes the tsukkomi role while interacting with others.
                            She is also known for making a raspy whispering voice when doing ASMR, leading into her being teased as Donald Duck. The joke was taken further on a 3D Livestream with Roboco where she made a 3D appearance as a duck wearing her signature baseball cap.
                            Her representative emote is an ambulance because one of her first tweets was an ambulance meme about her followers increasing.<br>
