                        <h5>Generation 0: Tokino Sora</h5>
                            <p>Tokino Sora the first Member of Hololive Productions and debuted on Sept. 7th, 2017.
                            Sora garners universal respect from all of her juniors in Hololive because she was one of the pioneers of early day VTubers. She generally does talking streams, gaming streams, as well as some occasional singing.
                            Her first ever stream was on NicoNico, a Japanese video hosting site like Youtube, for 50 viewers. But out of those 50, 37 were people she already knew and had asked to watch her debut stream, so only 13 viewers were completely unaware of what was going on. Those 13 people are now jokingly called "The 13 Knights" by fans. 
                            Starting out she didn't mind the low number of viewers as she was focusing on school and streaming was just something to do on the side. She thought that after about half a year, if the streaming wasn't successful, it would just naturally die out, but if she got lucky and it did become a big success, that would be nice. But after half a year had passed, she decided she doesn't want to stop because of all the people supporting her, whatever it was just watching her stream or sending fan mail, and whenever she would see someone say that watching her made them happy, she was glad she could have such an affect on people which motivated her to continue.
                            Although she claims that she is scared of horror games, she does not have a large reaction to jumpscares and scary moments, only showing brief surprise or shock. She is not good with things that involve memorization.
                            She has a really large vocal range, with some fans describing her voice to be high enough to be like a vocaloid, yet being able to be low enough to sound like an ikemen voice. Her singing teacher told her that her voice isn't really fit for "classical" music and she should do more idol-like songs.
                            Her representative emote is a bear after her stuffed bear side-kick Ankimo.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 0: Hoshimachi Suisei</h5>
                        <p>Hoshimachi Suisei (星街すいせい) born on March 22 is a cheerful shining Idol and VTuber from Hololive 0th Generation. She is a forever 18, multitalented girl who deeply loves singing and idols, with the dream of one day holding a live concert in Tokyo Budokan. She started out as an independent VTuber and later joined Inonaka Music, a music label under Hololive, before moving officially to Hololive main branch.
                            Her name "Suisei" translates to "Comet" in English, and as such is usually referred to as the comet idol. She is well known for her amazing skills in Tetris, as she is often being called out as the best among VTubers, as well as her psychopathic personality, as shown when she sometimes acts ruthless to others while still giving off a cheerful attitude.
                            Her representative emote is a comet.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 0: Roboco-san</h5>
                        <p>Roboco is a Virtual Robot in the Hololive 0th Generation of VTubers. Her character is that of a high-performance robot that is good with shooters. Along with other 0th generation members Sora and Miko, she does not have a 2D model and streams using her 3D model instead. She is usually called Roboco-san but since she was the 2nd member to join Hololive after Sora, she is sometimes called Roboco Senpai. She started as a 3D project (not intended to be a VTuber) by her designer kuromaru.
                        Her representative emote is a robot because she is a robot.<br>

                        <h5>Generation 0: Sakura Miko</h5>
                        <p>
                            Miko is a self-proclaimed "Elite" shrine maiden. More often than not this backfires and "Elite" becomes a common term used by her viewers to tease her whenever she makes mistakes or unlucky decisions due to her clumsy nature. Despite that, she has the determination to finish the challenges she face, having done numerous endurance streams which usually lasted for up to 12 hours.
                            In contrast to her occupation as a shrine maiden, Miko is an otaku at heart and has a deep passion for all things Eroge. She has defended her love for Eroges from her viewers in various occasions, explaining everything she likes about them from illustrations to sounds and visuals. She will also drop anything she's doing to rant at her viewers if she ever gets called out for liking Eroge only for its NSFW aspects. She is particularly fond of Eroges with a story that can make her cry, and favors blonde twin-tailed loli type characters, claiming at several occasions that Akai Haato is her #1 choice to romance if Hololive were to become a gal-game.
                            She was in the main cast of "Miko no Tsutome! (みこのつとめっ！)", which was the first series of short animations under the Holo Anime (ホロアニメ) brand, which was a precursor to Holo no Graffiti. In the series, she is accompanied by her pet pink cat shikigami named "Kintoki" (金時).
                            Her representative emote is a cherry blossom (Sakura).<br>
