                            <p>
                                Ookami Mio (大神ミオ) was born on August 20th as wolf-girl. An introductory video of Hololive Gamers was uploaded on December 6th, 2018, and would debut the day after in an introductory stream with Shirakami Fubuki. The creation of her YouTube channel was on December 1st, 2018, and her Twitter account was opened much earlier on November 16th, 2018. Her 3D model debuted on June 16, 2019, and a while later, her 3D swimsuit model would be shown on September 11, 2019. Mio would get her 2nd L2D outfit on December 22, 2019 alongside Fubuki. Her 3rd outfit, the New Years outfit, is given to Mio shortly afterward on January 1st, 2020.
                                Mio was an old gaming friend of Fubuki's and one day wondering what she was up to nowadays, decided to contact her. Fubuki explained she is in Hololive and Mio thought it sounded fun and decided to apply as well.
                                Her representative emote is a pine tree due to her hair resembling one.<br>

                        <h5>Generation Gamers: Nekomata Okayu</h5>
                        <p>
                            Nekomata Okayu is a cat girl VTuber in the Hololive Gamers unit. Okayu is known for her relaxing voice and calm disposition, both of which aren’t present when she, in very rare times, is playing a horror game. She has been playing games since childhood as her grandmother owned a lot of 80’s and 90’s games. She mainly plays RPG games and loves the Super Mario series. While not an RPG, one of her favorite games is Mario 64 which she took the time to learn the speedrunning strategies for. When playing RPG games, Okayu often adds depth to the characters’ personalities by establishing quirky traits unique to that playthrough. For example, when playing Paper Mario, Okayu had no reason to upgrade Kooper and he ended up being the last one to be upgraded despite being the 2nd one to join the team. This led to Kooper being the sandbag of the team and the butt of many "useless" jokes since other characters like Bombette and Parakarry did his job better than he could.
                            Her representative emoji is an Onigiri (rice ball) since she used to live with an old lady in a rice ball store, and her fans are called the Onigirya (the Rice Balls).<br>

                        <h5>Generation Gamers: Inugami Korone</h5>
                        <p>
                            Inugami Korone is a dog girl VTuber in the Hololive Gamers sub-unit. She is 94 dog years old. She works at a bakery, thus the bread and pastry theming around her.
                            Korone is known for her endurance streams where she streams the same game for very long time, usually 5-12 hours.
                            Korone loves to play Kusoge or Bakage. She finds both kinds of games very endearing and will laugh at them instead of getting frustrated at the bad parts.
                            She is very close friends with Nekomata Okayu even before joining Hololive and the pair is often referred to as "Okakoro".
                            Korone doesn't tend to follow "trends" or what is popular. When everyone else was playing Animal Crossing for the Switch as soon as it came out, Korone decided to play a Gegege no Kitaro SNES game.
                            Some Japanese fans have compared Korone to the Japanese TV station TV Tokyo, that will air anime or other programs instead of talking about important current events like other channels at the same time are doing.
                            She has said she did not audition for Hololive, but got in due to being referred by Okayu, although in a now private HoloRadio episode, Fubuki says she saw Okayu and Korone at an arcade and decided to ask them to join.
                            Her representative emote is a croissant, because she works at a bakery.<br>
